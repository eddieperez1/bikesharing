## Overview of the statistical analysis

### Project Goal
This analysis looks NYC CitiBike Data to see if bike share can be implemented in Des Moise. Then analyze how it works in NYC and propose how it can work in Des Moise. The citibike data for August 2019 was analyzed. [Link to Data](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data)

### Statistical Insights
By using the avg, sum and count of trip duration, number of riders and number of riders by gender and number of users, and various other data points, this project creates visualization to:
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week
- Show the starting and ending locations for bike trips 


## Results

### Checkout Times by User

## Summary

### Insights
Insights from the results are that most riders are male and most riders take trips less than 1 hour. Hence it can be predicted who will use citibike and how long rides are in Des Moise. The problem with implementing these conclusions is that New York City is very different from Des Moise. The population, work style and travel methods are different in New York City and Des Moise. Based on the Trips by Weekday shows that most riders use citibike in the morning and evening on weekdays and afternoons on weekends. This conclusion is not based on the location of New York City so this insight can be used to implement citibike in Des Moise.

### Additional Analysis
To give additional insights to the analysis, population maps of Des Moise and tourism of Des Moise can be investigated. Using the top starting and ending locations along with population and tourism data of Des Moise can help make descisions about where to put the citibike locations.
